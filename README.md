#### A little bit about me:
> My name is Psalm De Mesa and I am a 15-year-old Filipino student at WSC.
> I watch movies, anime, and TV shows in my free time.
> But I mostly scroll on my phone and cook for my family. I could play my guitar and jam for hours if I try to not use my phone for the day. 
> The sports that I play are badminton, volleyball, and a bit of basketball.

#### Past Projects
###### **3d Models in Blender**
> *This was a project we did in Year 10 and the 3d models that I made were a Hello Kitty-inspired car, a soccer ball, and a complex tree.*
###### **Simple Game Making**
> *One of my favourite projects that we did in Year 10 was we tried our games and coded them ourselves. I forgot what site/program we used but it was simple and easy to navigate around.*
#### Why I chose Digital Technology
> I am inspired by my mom because she is a test analyst. I saw her looking at codes and testing the website itself if it works and if the client is content with how it is done. I also saw her looking at references that designers have made and they were amazing. This is why I chose Digital technology because I know that this subject would cover coding, learning about Javascript and other languages, designing my website, and how to format a website. 
#### Languages/Tools that I use:
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
